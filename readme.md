## What is this?

Files for tiny web app/demo using context-free
grammars to generate pronouncements about fashions.

The idea is partially inspired by the writings of
the French theorist Roland Barthes and is built
using Kate Compton's excellent Tracery javascript
library.

I am currently using this repo for local development
on multiple machines and the project is unfinished.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Finish grammars for clothes, food, philosophy and games
- [ ] Publish basic version
- [ ] Build more complexity into the grammars
- [ ] Investigate generation of images/sound
