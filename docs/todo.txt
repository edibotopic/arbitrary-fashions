### quotes

fashion is nothing but one says it is

if hair has become long, it is because it was short before

fashion tries hard to make the written item of clothing correspond to uses, characters, seasons, functions: 'a dress for evening wear, for shopping, for spring, for the student, for the carefree young girl...'

in reality fashion is never functional, never utilitarian

after a period of short skirts, we will automatically have a period of long skirts
